# Stage 1: Foundation & Entity Layer - Completion Report

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Date:** November 9, 2025
**Branch:** `main`

---

## Summary

Stage 1 focused on establishing the foundation for the product showcase application: FakeStore API integration, product entity with RTK Query, type-safe persistence utilities, and comprehensive testing infrastructure.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. API Integration & Contracts

- ✅ FakeStore API audit and documentation ([docs/api-contracts.md](api-contracts.md))
- ✅ Base API configured with `https://fakestoreapi.com`
- ✅ Endpoint contracts documented (GET /products, GET /products/:id)

### 2. Product Entity (`entities/product`)

- ✅ Domain types: `Product`, `ProductDTO`, `ProductRating`, `ProductCategory`
- ✅ DTO mappers: `mapProductDTO()`, `mapProductsDTO()`
- ✅ RTK Query endpoints: `getProducts`, `getProductById`
- ✅ Exported hooks: `useGetProductsQuery`, `useGetProductByIdQuery`
- ✅ Public API compliant with FSD

### 3. Persistence Utilities (`shared/lib/persist`)

- ✅ Type-safe localStorage helpers: `getFromLS()`, `setToLS()`, `removeFromLS()`
- ✅ SSR safety (Next.js App Router compatible)
- ✅ Error handling with console logging
- ✅ Public API exports

### 4. Testing & Validation

- ✅ API smoke test: `/test-api` _(removed at Stage 2A start)_
- ✅ Persist smoke test: `/test-persist` _(removed at Stage 2A start)_
- ✅ All linting checks passing
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks validated

## 🚀 Next Steps (Stage 2)

### Deferred Items

- **Fallback to mocks** — moved to Stage 2 (will activate mock fallback when API fails)
- **UI components** — ProductCard, Grid, Toolbar
- **Features** — search, pagination, favorites, remove

### Stage 2 Focus: UI & Features

See [docs/stage-2-plan.md](stage-2-plan.md) for detailed plan.

**Key activities:**

1. Implement mock fallback for API errors
2. Create Product UI components (Card, Grid, Toolbar)
3. Build features: search (debounce), pagination (client-side), favorites, remove
4. Implement ProductState persistence integration
5. Create main product showcase page

## 📝 Post-Scriptum

**Smoke test routes removed:** `/test-api` and `/test-persist` were legacy interactive smoke tests created during Stage 1 for manual validation of RTK Query endpoints and localStorage utilities. These routes were removed at the start of Stage 2A to reduce navigation noise and improve codebase clarity. The functionality they validated remains fully operational and will be covered by automated unit and integration tests in Stage 2.
